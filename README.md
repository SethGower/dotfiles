# Seth Gower's dotfiles

### Installation

I use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to install and link my dotfiles. 


All you need to do is simply clone this repo (I suggest into `~/.dotfiles`)

```sh
stow i3 polybar vim
```

Or you can use any of the other package folder in this repo.
