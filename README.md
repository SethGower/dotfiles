# Dotfiles for my rice

These are the dotfiles for my arch rice.

Here are some various plugins I am using

- [ZSH Auto suggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
- [ZSH Syntax Highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
- [vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex)

I am still working on getting [deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim) to work. 

This is my background. It is a cipher that a friend of mine made, and then another friend made the actual photo. It is my name.
